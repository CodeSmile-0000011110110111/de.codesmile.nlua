[NLua 1.7.5](https://github.com/NLua/NLua) wrapped as a Unity package, installable with Unity PackageManager instead of NuGetForUnity.

I just don't like having NuGet installed _into_ my projects. ;)

# Installation

First, be sure you REALLY want NLua whose latest official version dates back to 2021!

Consider using the modern, maintained and faster [LuaCSharp](https://github.com/nuskey8/Lua-CSharp) instead. I also have this [as a Unity package](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.luacsharp).

To install NLua package:
- Open Package Manager
- Choose **Install package from Git URL...**
- Enter this URL: `https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.nlua`

Beats NuGet every time when you know what you want!

# Changes

None. Same as what you get through NuGet.

# More Lua goodies ...

My goal is to use Lua in Unity for everything.
